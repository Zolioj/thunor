Welcome to Thunor Core's documentation!
=======================================

Thunor Core is a Python package for managing and viewing high
throughput screen data. It can calculate and visualize both single-timepoint
viability calculations, and the multi-timepoint drug-induced proliferation
rate (DIP rate) metric, which is a dynamic measure of drug response.

For further information on Thunor, related projects (including a
web interface, Thunor Web), and further help see the `Thunor website`_.
