# Dose response curves and drug induced proliferation (DIP) rates in Python

## Implementation

PyDRC makes extensive use of [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and 
[plotly](http://plot.ly/python/), so familiarity with those libraries is 
recommended.

## Requirements

 * **numpy**
 * **scipy**
 * **pandas**
 * **plotly**
 * **pytables** for HDF5 format read/write
 * **seaborn** for colour palette selection

## Examples

See the Jupyter notebook `tutorial.ipynb` for worked examples.
